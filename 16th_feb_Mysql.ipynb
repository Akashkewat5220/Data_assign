    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It provides a way to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently. Databases are widely used in various applications and systems to handle large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They have predefined schemas and use tables to store data in rows and columns. SQL databases are typically good for complex queries and transactions, and they ensure data consistency and integrity. Examples of SQL databases are MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that provide a flexible schema for storing and retrieving data. They are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle a high volume of traffic and data. They are commonly used in applications where data is rapidly changing or unstructured. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and CouchDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, scalability needs, data structure, and the nature of data being stored."

    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It provides a way to ensure data integrity and enforce entity integrity constraints. Each primary key value must be unique and not null. Typically, a primary key is chosen from one or more columns that have unique values and can uniquely identify a record. For example, in an \"Employees\" table, the \"id\" column can be designated as the primary key if it satisfies the uniqueness and not null requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as a parent-child relationship. The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. This constraint helps maintain data consistency and allows the enforcement of relational integrity rules. For example, in an \"Orders\" table, there might be a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that references the primary key \"id\" column in the \"Customers\" table, indicating which customer placed the order"
